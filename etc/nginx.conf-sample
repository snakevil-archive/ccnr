# Q: HOWTO use any other code folder name, like `ccnr.git', rather than `ccnr'?
# A:
#    1. Adds an `alias' directive into `location ^~ /ccnr/share' as the head
#       line;
#    2. Changes `$1' in every `rewrite' directive in `location ~ ^/ccnr/' to
#       the name you want beginning with a `/';
#    3. Saves and reloads.
